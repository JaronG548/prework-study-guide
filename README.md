# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This webpage's purpose is to be a prework study guide for myself concerning the information I learned during the prework which includes HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation was to have notes for myself throught my coding career and to show what I learned during the prework stage of the bootcamp. I built this project to practice my skills and have a reliable place to view my notes. The problem this solves is that it shows my notes but also applys what I learned through the webpage. I learned about the topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and practiced how to apply them by using Github, Gitbash and VScode.
